Answers to the text questions go here.

part 1 D answer :    
    1- Technical text : this method relies on sentences lenght and syllable count to asses dificulty 
        however this can sometimes lead to inaccurate results. for example if a text is about an abstract
        subject that is hard to understand but is written in simple words , would get a low fk score 
        despite being hard. or a specialized text might seem to use long words and scored as hard to understand
        but is actually easy to understand for the target audience.
    2- Figurative language, Irony and idioms:
        fk can not detect literacy devices that increase cognative load,such as metaphors, irony, idioms.
        A sentence that is grammatically simple but conceptually profound or ironic
        might score as "easy" even if it requires significant interpretation.

part 2 f :
    In this part I was able to achive the f1 score of .7154 on SVM classifier which was increased from
    the f1 score of .6592. this is a signifacnt increase in accuracy . To achive this reuslt
    i created a custome spacy tokenizer for to handling tokenization of the text.
    content_pos_tag filter is used ({"NOUN", "PROPN", "ADJ", "VERB", "ADV", "PRON"}) to focus on content words 
    that can be helpful in reducing noise from less informative words.
    punctations and numbers are also filtered, also in the custome tokenizer spacy's built-in stop_words
    is used which has resulted in increased accuracy.
    for better optimization of TfidfVectorizer, ngram_range=(1,3) has been used which after many test proved to
    be the best value . also a min_df of 10 (it means the term must apear in at least 10 documents) was the best value
    with tested values of (1,2,3,4,5,10).also the sublinear_tf was set to True which dampens the impact of
    very frequently occuring terms in one document, emphesizing the importance of less frequent but potentially 
    more relevent terms.

    here is the final result : 
    
    (8078, 8)
